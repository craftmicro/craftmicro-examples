Simple example of Craft Micro running on TTGO T-Display S3 with PlatformIO and Arduino.

The TTGO T-Display is an ESP32 based development board with a built-in 1.9 inch ST7789 TFT display.

Bodmer's excellent TFT_eSPI library is used to drive the display (see [platformio.ini](platformio.ini) for TFT setup)

Plays an animation in the center of the display.
